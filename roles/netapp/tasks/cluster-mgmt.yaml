# This will ensure that we have configured a failover group and policy for our
# cluster management lif, so that it will only migrate to controller's e0M ports
# which are connected to the management network.
# Unfortunately, ansible modules do not seem to offer a way to create failover
# groups, so we need to run the following command manual:
# system::> network interface failover-groups create -vserver system -failover-group mgmt_failover -targets system-01:e0M,system-02:e0M

# Next we need to configure the cluster management lif to use the above failover
# group. Equivalent netapp cli command:
# system::> network interface modify -vserver system -lif cluster_mgmt_lif -failover-policy system-defined -failover-group mgmt_failover
- name: Ensure Cluster Management interface failover group
