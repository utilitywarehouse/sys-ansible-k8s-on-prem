# Ideally we want to fetch this directly on the target host via get_url from
# our bucket roles/dhcp/files/ipxe.pxe. The problem here is that we need to
# specify a vrf on cumulus to be able to talk to the internet and this is not
# available via the ansible command. Thus we include ipxe binaries in the repo
# and use a simple copy to put it in place.
# ipxe.pxe is built from https://github.com/utilitywarehouse/sys-ipxe and
# contains a custom boot script to retry dhcp mulpiple times. This is needed by
# m700 nodes, where we noticed that dhcp responses could get lost and nodes
# might fail to boot.
