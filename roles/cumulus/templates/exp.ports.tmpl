# ports.conf --
#
# This file controls port aggregation and subdivision.  For example, QSFP+
# ports are typically configurable as either one 40G interface or four
# 10G/1000/100 interfaces.  This file sets the number of interfaces per port
# while /etc/network/interfaces and ethtool configure the link speed for each
# interface.
#
# You must restart switchd for changes to take effect.
#
# accton,as6812_32x has:
#     32 QSFP+ ports numbered 1-32
#     These ports are configurable as 40G, split into 4x10G ports or
#     disabled.
#
#     The X pipeline covers QSFP ports 1-16 and the Y pipeline
#     covers QSFP ports 17-32.
#
#     The Trident2+ chip can only handle 52 logical ports per pipeline.
#
#     This means 13 is the maximum number of 40G ports you can ungang
#     per pipeline, with the remaining three 40G ports set to
#     "disabled". The 13 40G ports become 52 unganged 10G ports, which
#     totals 52 logical ports for that pipeline.

# QSFP+ ports
#
# <port label 1-32> = [4x10G|40G|disabled]
